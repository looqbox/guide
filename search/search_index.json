Each of those scripts access a datasource (e.g. MySQL), so the time that a users waits is mainly the response time from the query or API. The maximum recommended time for a response is 2 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers usually need a bit of experience with the interface to start asking more complex questions, so starting with short and general questions help new users to navigate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe discorage the implementation of complex dashboards in Looqbox, since it usually depends of multiple queries, which result in a long response time.\n\n\nTo guarantee the best user experience, responses should be implemented in a way that users can ask simple questions, and navigate to more specific information using features like drill down. Navigating between 4 tables of content waiting 2 seconds for each load in much better than waiting 8 seconds for a single dashboard.\n\n\nHere is a sequence of questions to illustrate this scenario:\n\n\n\n\nsales $date\n\n\nsales $date by store\n\n\nsales $date by department\n\n\nsales $date by supplier\n\n\n\n\nSetting up a connection\n\n\nCreating a response\n\n\nHere you can link keywords to a script. \nWe will divide this section 3 parts.\n\n\nBasic info\n\n\nResponse Name: use a name to find this response easily later\n\n\nResponse Group: each response must belong to a response group, used to control who can access this resource\n\n\nEngine: R (default) is the only engine available for scripts\n\n\nCustom evaluation time limit: ATTENTION.

To illustrate:\n\n\nImagine that it's important for a user to ask about sales \"sales yesterday\" (which returns a table with the sales in each store), but it's also common to modify the answer by asking \"sales yesterday store 1, 2 and 3\" (which returns a table with the sales of store 1, 2 and 3).
