## Setup for the Tutorial

You can either write the code in your RStudio Serve, or you can set up a local development environment on your computer and use your local RStudio.

This is the quickest way to get started!

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787), enter your **username** and **password** and you're almost ready to go.

Go to your looqbox addin and set your admin user.

You can now skip the second setup option, and go to the [basics section](#basics) to get an overview of React.
